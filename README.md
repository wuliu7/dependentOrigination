From Consciousness, Mind and Matter Arises
CONSCIOUSNESS produces mind and matter. Therefore, with the arising of rebirth-consciousness, mind and matter also arise. Rebirth-consciousness is invariably coupled with feeling (vedanā), perception (saññā), contact (phassa), volition (cetanā), attention (manasikāra), and other mental properties relating to the objects of deathbed visions. Every unit of consciousness is accompanied by these mental properties (cetasikā). The rebirths of some Brahmās, devas, and human beings involve the three wholesome roots of generosity, goodwill, and wisdom. Some beings are reborn with just the two roots of generosity and goodwill, while the births of earthbound devas and human beings with defective organs lack any wholesome roots. However, their rebirth is still a favourable rootless-birth as distinct from the unfavourable rootless-birth of the denizens of the lower realms.

Rebirth may take one of three modes: rebirth from a mother, rebirth in putridity (saṃsedaja), or sudden rebirth of the fully developed physical body (opapātika). Rebirth from a mother is of two kinds: viviparous for human beings and other mammals, and oviparous for birds and reptiles. These living beings may differ in origin as they do in size and gestation or incubation period. I will leave it at that now, and go on with human rebirth as described in the Commentaries.
